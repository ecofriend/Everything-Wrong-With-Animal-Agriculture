## Preamble

Animal agriculture is one of the most destructive forces on this planet. While hunting and eating animals may have been a necessity for our ancestors when plant foods were hard to come by (e.g. during winter, or droughts), for most people on earth today that is not the case.

The goal of this document is to curate the evidence and arguments that have been presented over the years to show animal agriculture is harmful and to encourage consumers and producers to move toward plant-based food choices.
