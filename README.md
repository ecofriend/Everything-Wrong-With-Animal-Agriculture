# Everything Wrong With Animal Agriculture

This document is a curation of the many ways in which animal agriculture is harmful to the planet, communities, human health and animals. You are welcome to make pull requests to help me keep this document updated and fill in any missing pieces. If you are interested in doing so, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Preamble

Animal agriculture is one of the most destructive forces on this planet. While hunting and eating animals may have been a necessity for our ancestors when plant foods were hard to come by (e.g. during winter, or droughts), for most people on earth today that is not the case.

The goal of this document is to curate the scientific evidence and arguments that have been presented over the years to show animal agriculture is harmful and to encourage consumers and producers to move toward plant-based food choices.

  - ### [The Opportunity Cost of Animal Based Diets Exceeds All Food Losses](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1713820115)

    > Plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) can produce twofold to 20-fold more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland. Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people, more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss.

        > Global dietary patterns need to converge around diets based more
    on plants, owing to the disproportionate impact of animal farming on
    biodiversity, land use and the environment. Such a shift would also benefit
    the dietary health of populations around the world, and help reduce the risk
    of pandemics.

      > The increase in meat and dairy production in Europe over the past decade has made farming a much greater source of emissions, but while governments have targeted renewable energy and transport in their climate policies, initiatives to reduce the impact of food and farming on the climate have lagged behind.

      ![Organic meat production just as bad for the climate](/images/organic_meat.png)

      > Organic livestock are not fed imported fodder and are often grass-fed, but this means they produce less meat and grow more slowly, therefore spending longer emitting greenhouse gases before slaughter, the researchers said. Plants grown organically have half the climate costs of conventional produce as they do not rely on chemical fertilisers, but all plants have far lower emissions than animal products.

      > At the family level, youth climate activism may begin at the dinner table. By refraining from eating foods that violate their beliefs about the well-being of animals, children would also be acting in a manner consistent with their moral views of the environment. In addition to reducing their own carbon footprints, children's principled eating behaviors may also influence those of their parents.

But governments and green campaigners are doing nothing to tackle the issue due to fears of a consumer backlash, warns the analysis from the thinktank Chatham House.

      > Sixty-five million gallons of cows’ milk are produced in Sonoma County every year. It takes about 1,000 gallons of water to make a gallon of cows’ milk meaning 65 billion gallons of water are used to support the dairy industry in Sonoma annually.

      > The production of animal protein requires significantly more water than the production of plant protein. Although US livestock directly uses only 2% of the total water used in agriculture, the indirect water inputs for livestock production are substantial because of the water required for forage and grain crops. Each year, a total of 253 million t grain are fed to US livestock, requiring a total of about 66,000,000,000,000 gallons of water.

      > “As people switch to eating animal-based protein diets, we eat more and more nitrogen, and then we excrete almost all of it out,” lead author Cascade Tuholske, a geographer and postdoctoral research scientist at Columbia University’s Earth Institute, told The Daily Beast. In a nutshell, he said the findings show, “Hey, you're eating a ton of burgers. And some of those ecological impacts are methane emissions, land-use change, [agriculture] runoff, but it's also having a huge impact just from our wastewater.”

    > In North Carolina, the number of pigs on factory farms nears the total population of people in the state. The contamination from North Carolina pig farms has yielded dangerous concentrations of groundwater nitrates, a leading cause of blue baby syndrome: a condition in which a baby’s skin turns blue due to insufficient oxygen in their blood, which can lead to death. Hydrogen sulfide has also caused noticeable increases in respiratory ailments near these sites. And because of the location of these farms, those affected most are low-income Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities.

    > What’s really remarkable about this “vegan” farm is the size of its vegetables. Organic yields are typically 20-30% lower than farms that use synthetic fertilisers and chemical pesticides. But Oiko Bio has had a spectacular harvest this year. One hokkaido plant has produced nine squashes; plants often produce only two. This 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) field produced 1,500kg of courgette: 7.5 tonnes per hectare. The previous year, on the same field, with similar weather, it was five tonnes.

    > Data from Kantar’s usage panel, which records online weekly meal diaries from around 11,000 people in Britain, showed that for the 52 weeks ending August 2020 a mail meal containing meat or fish cost an average of £1.77 per person. A plant-based meal cost an average of £1.06 per person. The savings where ‘fairly equal’ across lunch and dinner.
