# Everything Wrong With Animal Agriculture

This document is a curation of the many ways in which animal agriculture is harmful to the planet, communities, human health and animals. You are welcome to make pull requests to help me keep this document updated and fill in any missing pieces. If you are interested in doing so, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Preamble

Animal agriculture is one of the most destructive forces on this planet. While hunting and eating animals may have been a necessity for our ancestors when plant foods were hard to come by (e.g. during winter, or droughts), for most people on earth today that is not the case.

The goal of this document is to curate the scientific evidence and arguments that have been presented over the years to show animal agriculture is harmful and to encourage consumers and producers to move toward plant-based food choices.

  - ### [The Opportunity Cost of Animal Based Diets Exceeds All Food Losses](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1713820115)

    > Plant-based replacements for each of the major animal categories in the United States (beef, pork, dairy, poultry, and eggs) can produce twofold to 20-fold more nutritionally similar food per unit cropland. Replacing all animal-based items with plant-based replacement diets can add enough food to feed 350 million additional people, more than the expected benefits of eliminating all supply chain food loss.

      ![Organic meat production just as bad for the climate](/images/organic_meat.png)

      > Organic livestock are not fed imported fodder and are often grass-fed, but this means they produce less meat and grow more slowly, therefore spending longer emitting greenhouse gases before slaughter, the researchers said. Plants grown organically have half the climate costs of conventional produce as they do not rely on chemical fertilisers, but all plants have far lower emissions than animal products.

      > At the family level, youth climate activism may begin at the dinner table. By refraining from eating foods that violate their beliefs about the well-being of animals, children would also be acting in a manner consistent with their moral views of the environment. In addition to reducing their own carbon footprints, children's principled eating behaviors may also influence those of their parents.

But governments and green campaigners are doing nothing to tackle the issue due to fears of a consumer backlash, warns the analysis from the thinktank Chatham House.

    - ### [Global food system emissions could preclude achieving the 1.5° and 2°C climate change targets](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.aba7357)

      > To have any hope of meeting the central goal of the Paris Agreement, which is to limit global warming to 2°C or less, our carbon emissions must be reduced considerably, including those coming from agriculture. Clark et al. show that even if fossil fuel emissions were eliminated immediately, emissions from the global food system alone would make it impossible to limit warming to 1.5°C and difficult even to realize the 2°C target. Thus, major changes in how food is produced are needed if we want to meet the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Although US livestock directly uses only 2% of the total water used in agriculture, the indirect water inputs for livestock production are substantial because of the water required for forage and grain crops. Each year, a total of 253 million t grain are fed to US livestock, requiring a total of about 66,000,000,000,000 gallons of water.

In a nutshell, he said the findings show, “Hey, you're eating a ton of burgers. And some of those ecological impacts are methane emissions, land-use change, [agriculture] runoff, but it's also having a huge impact just from our wastewater.”

    > In North Carolina, the number of pigs on factory farms nears the total population of people in the state. The contamination from North Carolina pig farms has yielded dangerous concentrations of groundwater nitrates, a leading cause of blue baby syndrome: a condition in which a baby’s skin turns blue due to insufficient oxygen in their blood, which can lead to death. Hydrogen sulfide has also caused noticeable increases in respiratory ailments near these sites. And because of the location of these farms, those affected most are low-income Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities.

## <a name="faqs">Frequently Asked Questions</a>

- **Why is old information not removed?**<br/>
  Using older news articles shows a pattern of neglect of people's health, environmental degradation, and animal abuse that has largely gotten worse with the progression of time. <br/>
  In additiona, many issues reported in the older articles are still relevant today, e.g. ag-gag laws enacted several years ago are still in effect in many U.S. states.
- **Why don't resources link directly to research instead of news articles?**<br/>
  This collection is designed for general public who may have a difficult time parsing research papers. News articles often link to the original should one want to read the original research on which the article is based.
