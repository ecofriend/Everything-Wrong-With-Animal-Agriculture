# Everything Wrong With Animal Agriculture

This document is a curation of the many ways in which animal agriculture is harmful to the planet, communities, human health and animals. You are welcome to make pull requests to help me keep this document updated and fill in any missing pieces. If you are interested in doing so, please refer to the [Contributing](#contributing) section below.

## Preamble

Animal agriculture is one of the most destructive forces on this planet. While hunting and eating animals may have been a necessity for our ancestors when plant foods were hard to come by (e.g. during winter, or droughts), for most people on earth today that is not the case.

The goal of this document is to curate the scientific evidence and arguments that have been presented over the years to show animal agriculture is harmful and to encourage consumers and producers to move toward plant-based food choices.

      > “These companies are some of the world’s biggest contributors to climate change,” said Oliver Lazarus, one of the study’s three authors. “They’ve spent a considerable amount of time and money downplaying the link between animal agriculture and climate change.”

      > The increase in meat and dairy production in Europe over the past decade has made farming a much greater source of emissions, but while governments have targeted renewable energy and transport in their climate policies, initiatives to reduce the impact of food and farming on the climate have lagged behind.

      > "Restoring native forests could buy some much-needed time for countries to transition their energy grids to renewable, fossil-free infrastructure,” said Matthew Hayek, an assistant professor in New York University and the principal author of the new study.

      > Replacing 50% of all animal-based foods with plant-based alternatives – leads to 224 MMT less emissions per year in 2030, a reduction equivalent to the annual emissions of 47.5 million of today’s average passenger vehicles.

      > Sixty-five million gallons of cows’ milk are produced in Sonoma County every year. It takes about 1,000 gallons of water to make a gallon of cows’ milk meaning 65 billion gallons of water are used to support the dairy industry in Sonoma annually.

      > The production of animal protein requires significantly more water than the production of plant protein. Although US livestock directly uses only 2% of the total water used in agriculture, the indirect water inputs for livestock production are substantial because of the water required for forage and grain crops. Each year, a total of 253 million t grain are fed to US livestock, requiring a total of about 66,000,000,000,000 gallons of water.

    > In North Carolina, the number of pigs on factory farms nears the total population of people in the state. The contamination from North Carolina pig farms has yielded dangerous concentrations of groundwater nitrates, a leading cause of blue baby syndrome: a condition in which a baby’s skin turns blue due to insufficient oxygen in their blood, which can lead to death. Hydrogen sulfide has also caused noticeable increases in respiratory ailments near these sites. And because of the location of these farms, those affected most are low-income Black, Brown, and Indigenous communities.

    > What’s really remarkable about this “vegan” farm is the size of its vegetables. Organic yields are typically 20-30% lower than farms that use synthetic fertilisers and chemical pesticides. But Oiko Bio has had a spectacular harvest this year. One hokkaido plant has produced nine squashes; plants often produce only two. This 0.2-hectare (0.5-acre) field produced 1,500kg of courgette: 7.5 tonnes per hectare. The previous year, on the same field, with similar weather, it was five tonnes.
